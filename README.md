This is a very very simple tic-tac-toe game made in C++ and console based.

I have made this only using knowledge of a 10th grade highschool student in Romania so there could definitely be some improvements to be done.

Also, this is my first repo and commit.

Try it out, i bet you it is still fun.

I am open to discussion about improvements and changes.
